Higher Order Containers

- definition of higher containers
- discuss model of STL (wip)
- example : Bushes and partial Bushes + .. + monad transformers
- example : inductive Bush (H F X = 1 + X × F (F X))

- external & internal fps
- derive W² by example (working general construction)
- not clear how to M² (conductive Bushes) reducible to W

- Is there W³? external fp for 3rd order => internal fp for W¹
   W : Hcont ((* => *) => *) but this doesn't exist beauase of [[_]]T

- Discuss: adding fps to the syntax, give up the naive [[_]]T semantcis
- either coinductive syntax or add fos to the syntax

- discuss model of STL
- semantics : types, heredetary functors ? [[_]]C
- external fixpoints W² (maybe mention M²)
- Is there W³? external fp for 3rd order => internal fp for W¹
   W : Hcont ((* => *) => *) but this doesn't exist becuase of [[_]]T
- adding fp to the syntax (coinductive syntax or explicit fps)
- how to define semantics
- system F^ω like calculus +> HCont = Heredetary normal forms
- add explict fps (μ , ν) , is there semantics ?

– Is there semantics using heredetary functors
F : (* => *) => (* => *)

[[F]]T : (Set → Set) → (Set → Set)

[[_]]C : HCon A → [[ A ]]T

[[_]]Cat : (F : HCon A) → Cat [[F]]T

– try to remember, Zhili doesn't believe it.
