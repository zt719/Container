# Containers & Higher Order Conatiners

## Current stage

- The second order case in **2Cont.agda** is almost well studied and understood. But there is an agda issue when formalising **2W**.

- The syntax of higher order container in **HCont.agda** is inspired by the hereditary substitution of simply-typed lambda calculus paper. https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1863597.1863601

- External third order container **3W** give intermal first order **W**, need to change something.

- I (Zhili) am trying to prove the equations in **SCWF.agda** and **TmSCWF.agda**.

- How to relate the calculus of **Nf** and **ωF**?
